# Sixteen

Docs: [https://cotidia.github.io/UI](https://cotidia.github.io/UI)

Install sixteen with npm

```console
$ npm install sixteen
```

On your project level, import the required Sixteen components:

```scss
@import "sixteen/settings";

@import "sixteen/components/reset";
@import "sixteen/components/util";
@import "sixteen/components/type";

@import "sixteen/components/alert";
@import "sixteen/components/animation";
@import "sixteen/components/badge";
@import "sixteen/components/button";
@import "sixteen/components/datepicker";
@import "sixteen/components/dialog";

// Form
@import "sixteen/components/form/base";
@import "sixteen/components/form/table";

@import "sixteen/components/grid";
@import "sixteen/components/label";
@import "sixteen/components/menu";
@import "sixteen/components/table";
@import "sixteen/components/tag";
@import "sixteen/components/tab";
@import "sixteen/components/tooltip";
@import "sixteen/components/layout";
```

Save the file as `_site.scss`

Create your own settings file to override default values:

```scss
@import "/path/to/node_modules/sixteen/settings";

$font_size: 16px;
$base_line_height: 1.5em;
```

Save the settings file as `_settings.scss`, it should be placed in the same
folder as `site.scss`.

## Responsive font scaling system

As of version 0.3.0, sixteen now has a font scaling system built in, with the scale being
responsive. This means that you can define both:

- How the base font size (16px by default) will scale between mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop.
- How the font size of "normal" text scales up and down through the type scale range (micro up to
  jumbo).

To opt out of either of these features (either in totality or for a given responsive range) just set
the "multiplier" value to 1 (or the same as another responsive range to continue the range).

Additionally, we have a line height scaling factor, which determines how the line height changes
through the type scale range. This is mainly in because you will generally want the line height to
go down a little as the font size increases. (`1.5em` at `12px` is fine, but at `64px` it's too big,
and `1.2em` is better, for example.) Because this scale works just like the standard type scale, you
must provide a valude less than 1 if you want the line-heigh to actually decrease as the font size
increases.

So the following settings need to go in your previously-created `_settings.scss` file in order to
set the font scaling up (though the values below are the defaults as of v0.3.0).

```scss
// How to modify the base font size between the different viewports.
$font_size_multiplier--mobile: 1;
$font_size_multiplier--tablet: 1;
$font_size_multiplier--desktop: 1;

// The actual ratio between neighbouring font size variants (normal/emphasis, large/hero, etc.).
$font_size_ratio_multiplier--mobile: 1.125;
$font_size_ratio_multiplier--tablet: 1.333;
$font_size_ratio_multiplier--desktop: 1.333;

// How the line height should change between size variants (normal/emphasis, large/hero, etc.).
// Remember that this multiplier increases as the perceived font size increases, so to tighten the
// line height, you should use a number less than 1.
$line_height_ratio_multiplier: 0.94269;

// Actual base font size and line height that everything is calculated from.
$base_font_size: 16px;
$base_line_height: 1.5em;
```

You can see that the default font size is 16px and the default line height is 1.5em. Additionally,
by default, we have no scaling of the base 16px font size between mobile, tablet and laptop/desktop.
The font scale itself is also consistent between tablet and laptop/desktop, but does change for
mobile.

The responsive type scaling is achieved through the following methods:

- The `html` font size is set exactly to the base font size with the mobile, tablet laptop/desktop
  scaling factor applied.
- The actual font size of individual elements is then specified in `rem`s, calculated as a scaling
  factor of this base font size, which is simply calculated by taking the font scale type asked for
  and raising the scaling factor to the power of its distance from `normal`.

To give some concrete values here's what should be generated by these default values:

Font size   | Mobile                    | Tablet                    | Laptop/Desktop
------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
html        | `16px`                    | `16px`                    | `16px`
Micro       | `0.7901rem` = `12.6416px` | `0.5628rem` = `9.0048px`  | `0.5628rem` = `9.0048px`
Small       | `0.8889rem` = `14.2224px` | `0.7502rem` = `12.0032px` | `0.7502rem` = `12.0032px`
Normal      | `1rem`      = `16px`      | `1rem`      = `16px`      | `1rem`      = `16px`
Emphasis    | `1.125rem`  = `18px`      | `1.333rem`  = `21.328px`  | `1.333rem`  = `21.328px`
Medium      | `1.2656rem` = `20.2496px` | `1.7769rem` = `28.4304px` | `1.7769rem` = `28.4304px`
Large       | `1.4238rem` = `22.7808px` | `2.3686rem` = `37.8976px` | `2.3686rem` = `37.8976px`
Hero        | `1.6018rem` = `25.6288px` | `3.1573rem` = `50.5168px` | `3.1573rem` = `50.5168px`
Jumbo       | `1.8020rem` = `28.832px`  | `4.2087rem` = `67.3392px` | `4.2087rem` = `67.3392px`

In order to actually *use* the font scaling system, you must not set the `font-size` (or
`line-height`) property directly, but instead use the `font_size` mixin, defined in sixteen's
`type.scss`. That file also defines the various scale names - `$font_size--{name}`.

So to set a paragraph element with the class of `lead` to use `emphasis` font sizing, you use the
following SCSS:

```scss
p.lead {
    @include font_size($font_size--emphasis);
}
```

That will automatically add `font-size` and `line-height` as well as the relevant media queries in
order to cover the three responsive ranges (mobile, tablet, laptop/desktop).

## Custom buttons

Button settings:

```sass
$border-radius: 2px;
$button_border_width: 2px;
```

Example:

```sass

.btn {
    &--secondary {
        @include button-solid-attributes($brand_secondary);

        &.btn--outline {
            @include button-outline-attributes($brand_secondary);
        }

        &.btn--link {
            @include button-link-attributes($brand_secondary);
        }
    }
}
```
